# pi-interactive-subagents

Async subagents for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), running in Herdr panes. Spawn a sub-agent, keep working in the main session, and get the result steered back when it finishes. Fully non-blocking.

**Herdr-only fork.** See [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) for the upstream project.

## How it works

`subagent()` returns immediately. The sub-agent runs in its own Herdr pane without stealing keyboard focus. The first three agent panes form columns to the right of the parent Pi pane; additional agents are distributed vertically across those columns. A live widget above the input tracks every running sub-agent, and when one finishes, its result is steered into the main session as a notification that triggers a new turn.

```
╭─ Subagents ──────────────────────────── 2 running ─╮
│ 00:23  scout      active · bash 7m                 │
│ 00:45  scout-2    waiting 2m                       │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Spawn several in parallel — they run concurrently and steer results back independently as each finishes.

Herdr owns pane layout and focus. The extension submits commands atomically through Herdr and reads the pane's detected terminal output. Up to three right-hand agent columns are rebalanced after each spawn or cleanup. Additional agents split downward from the shortest column. If the terminal is too narrow for equal columns, the main Pi pane keeps the larger share and the remaining space is divided between agent columns. Set `PI_SUBAGENT_MIN_PANE_WIDTH` to change the width threshold; it defaults to `24` columns.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `subagent` | Spawn a sub-agent in a dedicated Herdr pane (async) |
| `subagent_message` | Message a sub-agent by name — steers it if running, resumes its session if finished |
| `subagents_list` | List available agent definitions |
| `ask_question` | *(sub-agent sessions only)* Ask the orchestrator a question and wait for the reply |

`pi-web-access` provides `web_search`, `fetch_content`, `source_check`, and `get_search_content`. Restricted children disable extension discovery and explicitly load package extensions when present in the project `.pi/npm`, configured agent `npm`, or global agent `npm` package root, searched in that order (the default global root is `~/.pi/agent/npm`). Install them in one of those roots before listing their tools.

There is also a `/subagent <agent> <task>` command for spawning directly.

### Spawning

```typescript
subagent({ agent: "scout", task: "Analyze the auth module" });
subagent({ agent: "worker", name: "dark-mode", task: "Implement the dark mode toggle" });
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `agent` | string | required | Which agent to spawn (must be known and permitted) |
| `task` | string | required | Task prompt |
| `name` | string | agent name | Display name for the pane and widget. Must be unique — duplicates are auto-suffixed (`scout`, `scout-2`, …) |
| `model` | string | agent's model | Override the model for this spawn |
| `cwd` | string | agent's `cwd` | Working directory (see [Role folders](#role-folders)) |

### Messaging

`subagent_message` is addressed **by name only**. Names are unique per session and persist after a sub-agent finishes, so the same name works either way:

```typescript
subagent_message({ name: "scout", message: "Also check the auth middleware" });
```

- **Running** — the message is typed into the live pane (newlines flattened) and picked up at the next turn boundary. The call returns immediately; the eventual completion still arrives as a steer message.
- **Finished** — the session is resumed with the message as the follow-up task, like a fresh spawn: fire-and-forget, always autonomous, result steered back later. The resumed run reclaims its original name.

Every spawn records name → session file in `artifacts/<sessionId>/subagent-registry.json`, so names stay addressable across pi restarts. A nested sub-agent that spawns children gets its own registry keyed by its own session id. Resume is refused with a clear error (listing known names) if the name isn't registered, the session file is gone, or the session predates sandboxed resume.

**Resume replays the original sandbox.** At spawn time the fully-resolved loadout — tool allowlist, backing extensions, model, thinking level, system prompt, spawn whitelist, cwd, and config roots — is snapshotted to `<session>.loadout.json`. Resume rebuilds the exact same restricted process from that snapshot rather than relaunching unrestricted.

### ask_question

A sub-agent can ask its orchestrator a single freeform question when requirements are ambiguous or a decision materially affects the work. The session **stays open** (parked as `waiting`) instead of exiting; the parent is notified with the sub-agent's name, replies via `subagent_message({ name, message })`, and the reply arrives as the sub-agent's next turn. Parallel questions are supported — each waiting sub-agent has its own name.

If the reply arrives while the sub-agent is still mid-turn, it is absorbed into the current turn — either way the question is marked answered and the session exits normally when the work is done. If the parent never replies, the pane stays open until a human closes it. Only available inside sub-agent sessions.

## Bundled agents

| Agent | Model | Tools | Role |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| **scout** | `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna` (max) | `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `ask_question` | Fast read-only codebase recon |
| **researcher** | `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna` (max) | `web_search`, `fetch_content`, `safe_bash`, `ask_question` | Web research, synthesized into a sourced brief |
| **worker** | `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna` (max) | `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `web_search`, `fetch_content`, `ask_question` + spawning | General implementer; may spawn `scout` and `researcher` |

All three are autonomous (`auto-exit: true`) and carry their identity in the system prompt (`system-prompt: append`).

## Custom agents

Place a `.md` file in `.pi/agents/` (project) or `~/.pi/agent/agents/` (global). Discovery priority: **project > global > package-bundled** — a project-local file overrides a bundled agent with the same name.

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: Does something specific
model: openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna
thinking: max
tools: read, edit, write, safe_bash, web_search, fetch_content, ask_question
session-mode: lineage-only
auto-exit: true
---

You are a specialized agent that does X...
```

### Frontmatter reference

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `name` | string | Agent name (used in `agent: "my-agent"`) |
| `description` | string | Shown in `subagents_list` |
| `model` | string | Default model |
| `thinking` | string | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max` |
| `tools` | string | Strict tool allowlist. Built-ins: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`. Extension-backed: `web_search`, `fetch_content`, `source_check`, `get_search_content`, `safe_bash`, `video_extract`, `youtube_search`, `google_image_search`. The control tool `ask_question` is added to restricted children automatically. Only the extensions backing the requested or automatically granted tools are loaded into the child |
| `subagent_agents` | string | Comma-separated agent names this agent may spawn. **Presence of this field grants the spawning toolset** (`subagent`, `subagent_message`, `subagents_list`) and restricts spawn targets to the list. Omit it and the agent cannot spawn at all |
| `skills` | string | Comma-separated skill names to auto-load |
| `session-mode` | string | `standalone` (default), `lineage-only`, or `fork` — see below |
| `system-prompt` | string | `append` or `replace`: pass the body as the child's `--append-system-prompt` / `--system-prompt`. Omit and the body is prepended to the task prompt instead |
| `auto-exit` | boolean | Auto-shutdown when the agent finishes (see below) |
| `interactive` | boolean | Whether stall/recovery transitions wake the parent (see below) |
| `cwd` | string | Default working directory |
| `disable-model-invocation` | boolean | Hide from `subagents_list`; still spawnable by explicit name |
| `cli` | string | `claude` runs the agent via the Claude Code CLI instead of pi |

### session-mode

- `standalone` — fresh session, no lineage link to the caller (default)
- `lineage-only` — fresh session with `parentSession` linkage for discovery/fork UX, but no copied turns
- `fork` — child session seeded with the caller's conversation context

### auto-exit

With `auto-exit: true`, the session shuts down when the agent's turn ends — the agent just writes its final message and stops (there is no "done" tool). The last assistant message becomes the summary returned to the parent. Recommended for all autonomous agents.

Notes:

- **Manual input does not strand an auto-exit sub-agent.** If a human types into the pane, the session still closes once that turn completes normally — only an escape/abort leaves it open.
- **Auto-exit is suppressed while work is in flight:** the session parks as `waiting` instead of exiting when an `ask_question` is still unanswered, or when the agent's own child sub-agents are still running (a worker can stop after dispatching children and stays open until the last result returns).

### interactive

Controls whether `stalled`/`recovered` status transitions send a steer message to the parent session. Defaults to the inverse of `auto-exit`: autonomous agents get stall pings; user-driven agents stay quiet (the user is already working in that pane — the widget still updates). Set explicitly to override.

## Tool access control

Access is **whitelist-only**. Every sub-agent process is launched with `--no-extensions` (extension discovery disabled) and `--tools <allowlist>`; only the extensions backing the allowed tools are loaded back in explicitly. There is no default toolset and no deny-list — a restricted agent gets its frontmatter tools plus the automatically granted `ask_question` control tool. The restriction survives resume via the loadout snapshot.

Spawns must name a known agent at **every** depth. A top-level session may spawn anything discoverable; a sub-agent may only spawn the agents in its `subagent_agents` list (enforced via `PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOWED`). There is no agentless spawn route, so a child can never escalate to a full-toolset profile by omitting its agent.

Extensions can register additional tools for sub-agents at runtime via `registerToolExtension(name, path)` on the `__pi_interactive_subagents` process global.

## Role folders

`cwd` starts a sub-agent in a directory with its own config, so role-specific setups (CLAUDE.md, skills, extensions) apply:

```
project/
└── agents/
    ├── game-designer/   ← CLAUDE.md, .pi/…
    └── sre/             ← CLAUDE.md, .pi/…
```

```typescript
subagent({ agent: "worker", cwd: "agents/sre", task: "Review the deployment pipeline" });
```

Set a per-agent default with `cwd:` in frontmatter.

## Status widget & configuration

The widget tracks each sub-agent from a runtime activity snapshot written by the child: `starting`, `active` (turn/provider/tool work), `waiting` (open for input or another stage), `stalled` (no valid snapshot for too long), or `running` (fallback). Sub-agent sessions also show their own tools widget — toggle it with `Ctrl+Alt+O`. Completion messages expand with `Ctrl+O`.

Status display is configured via `config.json` in the extension directory (copy `config.json.example`; it's gitignored):

```json
{
  "status": { "enabled": true }
}
```
